Travel Assistant is a smart, interactive web application built to enhance the travel experience using modern Web APIs. It’s designed to help users discover useful local insights based on their current location while also offering real-time interactivity and graceful performance adjustments.

The app utilizes 5 powerful browser APIs:

Geolocation API – To detect and display the user’s current latitude and longitude.

Weather API – To fetch live weather data for the user’s exact location using OpenWeatherMap.

Canvas API – Allows users to draw or mark favorite spots on a digital map, change colors, pen sizes, and even add text.

Network Information API – Automatically detects user network quality and displays a relevant message (e.g., low-speed alerts).

Intersection Observer API – Smooth animations for nearby places (restaurants, parks, museums) as users scroll.

Background Tasks API (via requestIdleCallback) – Displays helpful travel tips when the browser is idle.
